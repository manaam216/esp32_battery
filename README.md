# ESP32 Battery

## Introduction
An ESP32 circuit powered by Li-ion battery. The circuit also contains a battery charging circuit and an LDO to convert the voltage to 3.3V to power up LED.
The circuit also has a ADC reading measurement circuit to read the battery voltage through ESP's ADC. 

## TP4056 
The IC used for charging circuit is TP4056. This module is made for charging rechargeable lithium batteries using the constant-current/constant-voltage (CC/CV) charging method. In addition to safely charging a lithium battery the module also provides necessary protection required by lithium batteries.

## Software
The EDA used to design the project is EasyEDA
